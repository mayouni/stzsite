"""The house style of the Harobanda site diagrams, in code.

The palette and the primitives here were read off diagrams 1, 2 and 3 --
which were authored by hand -- so a drawn diagram sits beside them without
announcing that it was generated. `site/DIAGRAMS.md` is the register and
holds the brief each composition answers.

Everything is written in LOGICAL pixels on a 1376 x 768 canvas. Drawing
happens at S times that and is downsampled on save, because PIL does not
anti-alias lines or polygons -- supersampling is what keeps an edge clean.
